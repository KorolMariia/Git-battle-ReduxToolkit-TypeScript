# Git-battle Redux-Toolkit TypeScript
[Demo](https://git-battle-redux-toolkit.vercel.app/)

This app was created using the GitHub API to offer users fast and easy access to repositories.

- Users can filter repositories by programming language or through a search bar.
- Users can participate in "battles" between their friends or other repositories, comparing their popularity based on the number of followers or stars.
- This functionality provides an effective way to gauge the popularity of repositories on GitHub.

## This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

I used:

- ReactJS: functional components and hooks
- TypeScript
- Redux-Toolkit
- React-router-dom
- GITHUB API
- Axios
- Material-UI
- Vercel for Demo

#### To start the app do (development):

Firstly, you must add the file **.env** with your Github API access key.

> Note: You can generate it in your Github => Settings => Developer Settings.

You can see the file **.env-sample** - a sample of what it should look.

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```
